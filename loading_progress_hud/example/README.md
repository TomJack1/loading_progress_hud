Update: see this [article](https://medium.com/@nocnoc/the-secret-to-async-validation-on-flutter-forms-4b273c667c03) on Medium about async form validation

Sample app showing how to use modal_progress_hud in a login screen
that makes calls to a backend. Also shows method to manage form
verification with async calls (see [flutter/issues/9688](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/9688) for details).
